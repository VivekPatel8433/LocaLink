LocaLink is a Windows Forms desktop app built in C# / .NET, designed to enable multiple users on the same local network to exchange messages in real time.
This lightweight LAN chat system provides a simplified experience similar to WhatsApp or Microsoft Teams, featuring anonymous random chat, local service discovery, and self-hosted servers that any user can start.
Each instance of the app can act as both a client and server. Users can discover nearby servers automatically through UDP broadcast and choose which one to join.
The app supports chat rooms, direct messages, and optional collaborative drawing mini-games for a more interactive experience.
The project demonstrates event-driven programming, user interfaces, data connections, concurrent programming, asynchronous programming, and networking.
